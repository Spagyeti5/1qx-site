  explanation: "Let’s call the cost of a pencil p and a rubber r.\nThe question gives two equations:\n2p + 3r = £1.20\n4p + 6r = £2.40\n\nThe second equation is just double the first one, so we can’t solve for both values. But the question only asks for the price of one pencil.\n\nTry p = 20p:\n2 × £0.20 = £0.40\nThen 1.20 - 0.40 = £0.80 → That would be the cost of 3 rubbers.\n\nIt works! So the price of a pencil is 20p, even if we don’t know exactly how much a rubber costs.",
